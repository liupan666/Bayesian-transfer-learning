# Bayesian-transfer-learning
My master thesis code, which is about Bayesian inference and transder learning.

## Introduction of each file
TL-QQ.R is the main code file of my transfer learing algorithm.  
estimate.R shows one of situations in simulation.  
application.R contains our application in the thesis, which is about gene level expression.  
simulation and application.R contains all the code to do the simulation and application in our thesis. 

## Introduction of dataset
Simulation data is set by myself, which is shown in thesis specifically.  
Application dataset is Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and can be downloaded from https://gtexportal.org/.
